CTD-related custom applications used in the SEAN/GLBA oceanography vital sign.

The NPS Southeast Alaska I&M Network (SEAN) oceanography vital sign utilizes two Sea-Bird CTDs for data collection. The CTDs are utilized in a "primary/backup" system, where one CTD serves as primary in a particular monitoring season, while the other is idle that year, but can be used as the backup in case of sensor or other issues. At the end of the monitoring season, the CTD used that year is sent to Sea-Bird for calibration/maintenance. The other CTD is promoted to primary for the following season. The main reason for this is the turnaround for calibration/maintenance might not be sufficient to get the CTD back in time for the January (following season) survey.

Staring in 2023, CTD #7 shall serve as primary, and #8 as backup. The application files in this repository reflect the CTD in the filenames. The 2023 and 2024 subdirectories contain the calibration config files for the CTD in use for that monitoring year.
