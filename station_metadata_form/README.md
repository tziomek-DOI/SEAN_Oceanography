Oceanography Survey and Station Metadata Form

This simple data entry form is used during SEAN Oceanography surveys. It is intended for use with a USB GPS device on a Windows computer. The application is written in Python, uses the PyQt library for the user interface, and the serial library for the USB COM port communication.

The user must have Python installed in order to run the application. The app was developed using Python version 3.12 (the version available in Company Portal as of September 2025).

After downloading the files locally, run the app using the following command (assumes 'python' is in the user's path):
> python gps_app_v0.4py

(Once development is completed, the script's filename will change, and these instructions will be updated to reflect the 'production' script)
